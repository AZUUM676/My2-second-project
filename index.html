      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hey there! I'm Azuum, a passionate second-year Bachelor of Software
        Engineering student. My journey into the world of coding began with a
        curiosity for problem-solving and a love for creating innovative
        solutions. I aspire to merge my technical skills with creativity to
        develop impactful software that makes a difference
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, working
        on exciting projects, and constantly learning to stay ahead in this
        dynamic field. I believe in the power of software to transform ideas
        into reality and I'm excited to share my journey with you!
